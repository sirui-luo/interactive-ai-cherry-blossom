# 🌸 Interactive AI Cherry Blossom: Under the Galaxy

While the original explored emerald and gold holiday luxury, this version translates those complex systems into a Cherry Blossom under a Galaxy—a symbol of new beginnings, energy, and growth for 2026.

This project explores how AI-assisted development, combined with clear creative intent, can translate imagination into complex interactive systems.

## 📝 Prompt

Gemini 3 in Google AI Studio and Claude 4.5 Sonnet in Cursor:

```
Role: You are an expert 3D creative developer skilled in React 19, TypeScript, and Three.js (React Three Fiber).

Goal: Build a high-fidelity 3D web application called
“Grand Luxury Interactive Christmas Tree”.

Visual Style:
- Trump-style luxury aesthetic
- Deep emerald green + metallic gold
- Cinematic glow and bloom effects

Tech Stack:
- React 19
- TypeScript
- React Three Fiber
- Drei
- Postprocessing
- Tailwind CSS

Core Architecture:
- State Machine with two modes:
  - CHAOS: elements scattered in space
  - FORMED: elements assemble into a tree
- Dual-Position System:
  - ChaosPosition: random spherical coordinates
  - TargetPosition: cone-shaped Christmas tree
- Smooth interpolation (LERP) between states in useFrame

Key Systems:
- Foliage: massive particle system using THREE.Points + custom shaders
- Ornaments: instanced meshes with weighted physical “pull”
- Bloom post-processing for golden glow
- Polaroid-style photo decorations embedded in the tree
- Webcam-based hand gesture detection:
  - Open hand → unleash chaos
  - Closed fist → restore tree
  - Hand movement controls camera view

```

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sirui-luo/interactive-ai-cherry-blossom.git
   cd interactive-ai-cherry-blossom
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   > 📝 Note: Local dev mode uses localStorage for sharing (works in same browser only)
   > For full cloud sharing, see step 4

4. **Configure Cloudflare (Optional - for cloud sharing):**
   - Follow the detailed guide in `cloudflare-setup.md`
   - Copy `env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Cloudflare credentials
   - Use `npm run dev:vercel` to test with full Vercel environment

5. **Open your browser:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3010/`
   - Allow camera access for gesture control
   - Click "Upload Photos" to upload your photos


## 🎯 Usage

### Photo Upload & Sharing

1. **Upload Photos:**
   - Click "Upload Photos" button to select up to 22 images
   - Photos will appear as polaroids on the Christmas tree

2. **Generate Share Link:**
   - After uploading photos, click "Generate share link"
   - Wait 2-3 seconds for the upload to complete
   - Copy the generated link and share with friends

3. **View Shared Photos:**
   - Friends can open the share link in any browser
   - Photos will automatically load on the Christmas tree
   - No login or app installation required
   - Links expire after 30 days

### Gesture Controls

1. **Position your hand** in front of the webcam (visible in top-right preview)
2. **Move your hand** to control the camera angle:
   - Left/Right: Horizontal rotation
   - Up/Down: Vertical tilt
3. **Open your hand** (spread all fingers): Unleash chaos mode
4. **Close your fist**: Restore tree to formed mode

### Mouse Controls

When no hand is detected, you can:
- **Click and drag** to rotate the view
- **Scroll** to zoom in/out
- **Right-click and drag** to pan (disabled by default)

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 19 with TypeScript
- React Three Fiber (R3F) for 3D rendering
- Three.js for WebGL graphics
- @react-three/drei for helpers
- @react-three/postprocessing for visual effects

- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Backend (Photo Sharing)
- Vercel Serverless Functions
- Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible object storage)
- Cloudflare KV (key-value storage)
- AWS SDK S3 Client for R2 integration

### Features
- Hand gesture control via webcam
- Dynamic state transitions (CHAOS ↔ FORMED)
- Photo upload and cloud sharing
- Temporary share links (30-day expiration)
- Instanced rendering for performance
- Bloom and post-processing effects
